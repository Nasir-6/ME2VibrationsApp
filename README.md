# ME2VibrationsApp

This project was a full scale web application as part of my Final Year Project in my Master's degree at Imperial. The aim of which was to produce an application capable of allowing students to interact with the various Vibrations scenarios introduced in the 2nd year Mechanical Engineering (ME2) course at Imperial.

This was developed wholly using python with the help of a library called Dash Plotly. With the use of a Flask server it allowed the smooth integration of a python backend with the responsive capablities of several libraries such as Bootstrap, React.js and Plotly.js as demonstrated in the gif below.

The original application was deployed using Heroku. But having seen the promising benefits of the application, the Imperial Visualisations (ImpVis) team had revamped it for their servers with the aim of utilising it for future ME2 cohorts on the [ImpVis server](https://impvis.co.uk/launch/me2-vibrations-single-degree-of-freedom-v3/index.html?collection=38).

## What I learnt

- How to plan and develop a web application from start to finish
- Managing client expectations
- Deploying a Dash application using Heroku
- How to integrate a Python backend with the front-end using Dash Plotly
- Using Dash Plotly to create an interative and responsive UI
- How little I know about actually deploying a full-scale web application
- Not to get too hooked up on finding the perfect solution, sometimes you just have to go with what you know, else you might end up with nothing to show for
